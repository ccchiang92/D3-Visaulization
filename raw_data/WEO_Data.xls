Ministry of Finance (data retrieved from CEIC) and National Audit Office (NAO) (data obtained from NAO audit report) Latest actual data: 2019. Headline data (e.g., revenue and expenditure) is updated to 2018 number, but actual data of some detailed components (e.g. interest payment) is not available for 2018. Notes: Fiscal Balance: Data differ from official figures released by China?s Ministry of Finance mainly because of a difference in treatment of net contributions to the other accounts (e.g. Budget Stabilization Fund). General Government Debt: Data differ from official figures released by China?s Ministry of Finance because IMF numbers include, from 2010 onward, the stock of local government debt outstanding as reported in the June 2011 National Audit Office Report. For subsequent years, we have followed the amortization schedule outlined in the same report. Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal expansion is estimated for 2019 and projected for 2020, due to a series of tax reforms and expenditure measures in response to the economic slowdown.

Puerto Rico	General government net lending/borrowing	Percent of GDP		Source: Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico; and Fiscal and Economic Growth Plan Latest actual data: 2015/16 Notes: Last available fiscal data are from FY 2015/16. Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the Puerto Rico Fiscal and Economic Growth Plans (FEGPs), which were prepared in October 2018, and certified by the Oversight Board. In line with assumptions of this plan, IMF projections assume federal aid for rebuilding after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in September 2017. The projections also assume revenue losses from the following: Puerto Rico will lose federal funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) starting in 2020; federal tax incentives, which were neutralizing the effects of Puerto Rico?s Act 154 on foreign companies, will begin to decline starting in 2018; and the effects of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which reduce tax advantage of U.S. companies producing in Puerto Rico will narrow this revenue base. Given sizable policy uncertainty, some FEGP and IMF assumptions may differ, in particular, those relating to the effects of the corporate tax reform, tax compliance and tax adjustments (fees and rates); reduction of subsidies, freezing of payroll operational costs, improvement of mobility, and reduction of expenses; and increasing health care efficiency. On the expenditure side, measures include extension of Act 66, which freezes much government spending, through 2020; reduction of operating costs; decreases in government subsidies; and spending cuts in education. Although IMF policy assumptions are similar to those in the FEGP scenario with full measures, the IMF?s projections of fiscal revenues, expenditures, and balance are different from FEGP?s. This stems from two main differences in methodologies. First, IMF projections are on an accrual basis, FEGP?s are on a cash basis. Second, the IMF and FEGP make very different macroeconomic assumptions. Start/end months of reporting year: July/June GFS Manual used: Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001 Basis of recording: Accrual. IMF calculations are based on an accrual basis, whereas authorities' calculations are based on a cash basis. General government includes: General government is defined as all general governmental entities, excluding Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA). General government entities include the General Fund, Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority (PRIFA), Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (COFINA), Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (PRIDCO), Highways and Transportation Authority (HTA), University of Puerto Rico (UPR), Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico (GDB), and Municipal Revenues Collection Center (CRIM). In addition, pension funds (ERS, TRS, and JRS) are also considered as part of general government. Valuation of public debt: Current market value. Data for public debt have been provided by the authorities. The definition of government for public debt data excludes PREPA and PRASA and includes all other entities of general government in fiscal accounts.	-3.073	-2.116	-1.842	-2.111	-2.507	-2.589	-3.669	-2.145	2016

Expenditure projections are based on the budgeted nominal values adjusted to account for subsequent announcements of measures to respond to the outbreak of coronavirus. Revenue projections are adjusted for differences between IMF staff forecasts of macroeconomic variables (such as GDP growth and inflation) and the forecasts of these variables assumed in the authorities' fiscal projections (which did not incorporate the impact of the outbreak of coronavirus). IMF staff data exclude public sector banks and the effect of transferring assets from the Royal Mail Pension Plan to the public sector in April 2012. Real government consumption and investment are part of the real GDP path, which, according to the IMF staff, may or may not be the same as projected by the U.K. Office for Budget Responsibility.

Repatriation tax on foreign earnings (a provision of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), estimated at $250 billion, which accrued at end-2017 and recorded as capital transfer to the government in the GFS, was removed from government revenue. Staff's baseline projection embeds the impact of this tax provision over time to reflect the fact that corporations have eight years to pay off this tax liability. Notes: Revenue, expenditure, and net lending data are is compiled using SNA 2008, and when translated into GFS this is in accordance with GFSM 2014. Due to data limitations, most series begin 2001. Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the January 2020 Congressional Budget Office baseline adjusted for the IMF staff?s policy and macroeconomic assumptions. Projections then incorporate the effects of the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (all signed in March 2020). Finally, fiscal projections are adjusted to reflect the IMF staff?s forecasts for key macroeconomic and financial variables and different accounting treatment of financial sector support and of defined-benefit pension plans and are converted to a general government basis.
